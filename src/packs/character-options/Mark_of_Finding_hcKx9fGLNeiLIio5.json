      "value": "<p>You have an edge on tests made using the Track skill.</p><p>As a maneuver, you place a magic sigil on a creature within 10 squares. When you place a sigil, you decide where it appears on the creature’s body, and whether the sigil is visible to only you or to all creatures.</p><p>You always know the direction to the exact location of a creature who bears one of your sigils and is on the same plane. You can have a number of active sigils equal to your level, and can remove a sigil from a creature at will (no action required). If you already have the maximum number of sigils activated and you place a new one, your oldest sigil disappears with no other effect.</p>",
